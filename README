-----------------
REQUIREMENTS
----------------
The code needs to be run on the stdlinux environment.

-------------------
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------
1. Run "startServer.sh" script on the server machine specifying 
the server port i.e. listening port.

dharman@delta$ startServer.sh 30001

2. Run "startClient.sh" script on the client machine specifying
the server hostname, server port and name of file to be transferred.

dharman@beta$ startClient.sh delta 30001 testfile

3. To kill the running processes on either client or server, execute
the "killscript".

----------------------------
myTCPsocket.c, myTCPsocket.h
----------------------------
These files contain the custom TCP Socket implementation over UDP. 
The application will use this API for the socket calls such as SOCKET,
BIND, CONNECT, ACCEPT, SEND, RECV, CLOSE

---------------
TCPD.c, TCPD.h
---------------
These files contain the TCP layer implementation that handles sending and
receiving packets reliably over UDP.

----------------
Timer.c, Timer.h
----------------
These files contain the retransmission timer implementation in the form
of a delta list t enable timeout feature. The Timer process forks a Clock
process which sends repeated ticks to represent the progress of time.

----------------
client.c (ftpc)
----------------
Client application that sends a file to the server.

--------------
server.c (ftps)
--------------
Server application that receives files from remote client application.
